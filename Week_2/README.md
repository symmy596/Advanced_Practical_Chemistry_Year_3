# Advanced Chemistry Practical - Computational
## University of Bath, Department of Chemistry
### Week 2

### Part 1

This week will involve a general introduction to molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on making use of the Python programming skills that you first met in years 1 and 2 of your chemistry degree. It may be the case that you cannot recognise particular aspects of Python, if this is the case you are advised to investigate the links within the Jupyter notebook or alternatively look back on the exercises from first and second year.

Before we can start, it is necessary to install the appropriate codes for to perform this exercise. To do this, first open the *Anaconda Prompt* (Start Menu -> Anaconda 3 -> Anaconda Prompt), and type the following (each new line incidates that your should be pressing enter):

```
pip install pylj

pip install polypy

pip install scipy
```

You can now launch the Jupyter notebook from this command line by typing

```
jupyter notebook
```

The first notebook that you should open is that entitled `week_2.ipynb`. 

The notebook will launch in your C drive. This is unfortunate because your C drive will automatically wipe when you log off. So make sure you save the repo elsewhere before you log off. Hopefully BUCS will fix this issue in the coming days.
