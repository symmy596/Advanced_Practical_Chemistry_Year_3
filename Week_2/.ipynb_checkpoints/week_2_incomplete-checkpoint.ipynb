    "## Introduction to classical molecular dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical molecular dynamics** is one of the most commonly applied techniques in computational chemistry, in particular for the study of large systems such as proteins, polymers, batteries materials, and solar cells. In classical molecular dynamics, as you would expect, we use **classical methods** to study the **dynamics** of **molecules**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **classical methods** is used to distinguish from quantum mechanical methods, such as the Hartree-Fock method or Møller–Plesset perturbation theory. In these classical methods, the quantum mechanical **weirdness** is not present, which has a significant impact on the efficiency of the calculation. The need for quantum mechanics is removed by integrating over all of the electronic orbitals and motions and describing the atom as a fixed electron distribution. This **simplification** has some drawbacks, classical methods are only suitable for the study of molecular ground states, limiting the ability to study reactions. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine some way to **describe** this electron distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the model used to describe the electron distribution is usually **isotropic**, e.g. a sphere, with the electron sharing bonds between the atoms described as springs. \n",
    "\n",

    "    <br>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of a lot of chemistry is to understand the **energy** of the given system, therefore we must parameterise the **models** of our system in terms of the energy. For a molecular system, the energy is defined in terms of bonded and non-bonded interactions, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{\\text{tot}} = E_{\\text{bond}} + E_{\\text{angle}} + E_{\\text{dihedral}} + E_{\\text{non-bond}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, $E_{\\text{bond}}$, $E_{\\text{angle}}$, and $E_{\\text{dihedral}}$ are the energies associated with all of the bonded interactions, and $E_{\\text{non-bond}}$ is the energy associated with all the of the non-bonded interactions. In this project, we will be focusing on **atomic ionic solids**, where there are no covalent bonds between the atoms, therefore in this introduction will focus on the **non-bonded interactions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameterisation of the model involves the use of **mathematical functions** to describe some **physical relationship**. For example, one of the two common non-bonded interactions is the electrostatic interaction between two charged particles, to model this interaction we use **Coulomb's law**, which was first defined in 1785, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ E_{\\text{Coulomb}}(r_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q_iq_je^2}{r_{ij}}, $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where, $q_i$ and $q_j$ are the charges on the particles, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric permitivity of vacuum, and $r_{ij}$ is the distance between the two particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below the example code is shown. Here is function which models the electrostatic interaction using Coulomb's law, before plotting it (if you need a quick reminder of function definition, check out [this blog](http://pythoninchemistry.org/functions)). "
