# Advanced Chemistry Practical - Computational
## University of Bath, Department of Chemistry
### Weeks 4 and 5

These two weeks will involve an introduction to two point defects - Frenkel and Schottky defects. These are common point defects that are relevant to solid state chemistry. Students will design their own simulations to investigate how these two defects affect the transport and structural properties of calcium fluoride. The notebook explaining this weeks exercise is entitled 'weeks_4_and_5.ipynb'. It is a very short introduction that provides a direction for weeks 4 and 5.
